  "MeetingRecordActor — one gijiroku operation = one supervised actor run, a
  langgraph-clj StateGraph. Two flows share one auditable graph:

    ingest (record-op):  intake → record → END
        meeting/status/consent/recording/transcript become durable ground
        facts. This is the observe charter; always on, never an LLM call,
        never a distribution.

    assess (assess-op):  intake → advise → govern → decide → commit|hold|approval
        the scribe-LLM (sealed) proposes minutes (summary/decisions/action-
        items/cites/redactions) for :minutes/draft; the PrivacyGovernor
        enforces consent/tenant/redaction/no-actuation invariants; the phase
        gate adds caution; `:minutes/distribute` ALWAYS routes to a human
        (interrupt-before :request-approval), whatever the phase.

  Single invariant (the gijiroku analog of robotaxi's safety contract): the
  actor never commits minutes the PrivacyGovernor would reject, and never
  distributes anything itself — it drafts a record; a human-approved
  Distributor port does the actual send."
