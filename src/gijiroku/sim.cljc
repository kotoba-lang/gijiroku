  "Demo: drive meeting records through one MeetingRecordActor.

    ingest m-adhoc   register + consent + recording + transcript (observe → facts)
    draft  m-weekly  consent on file, no sensitive segments → clean → auto-commit (phase 3)
    draft  m-perf    NO consent recorded yet → HARD HOLD (no human override)
    draft  m-perf    (careless advisor cites the health segment, no redaction)
                     → HARD HOLD even after consent is recorded (no human override)
    distribute m-weekly → valid participant recipients → always human sign-off (interrupt)
    distribute m-weekly → a non-participant recipient → HARD HOLD (tenant-isolation)
    phase 0          draft in observe-only phase → held (phase-disabled)
